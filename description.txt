This mod adds a dedicated wing slot to the inventory. Now includes a config file! Access it from the in-game Mod Configuration.

!!! WARNING !!!
Remove items from the slots before disabling the mod; they will not be returned to your inventory!

Due to the update to tModLoader 1.4, the following features have changed:
* Slots can only be placed at the bottom of accessories or in a custom location
* Slots cannot be placed on another equipment page
* Custom slot location is stored per-character

[Credits]
