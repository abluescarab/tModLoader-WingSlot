!!! WARNING !!!
Unequip your wings/boots/balloons from the dedicated slots before updating or disabling this mod, or before installing WingSlot with it!

------

This mod adds dedicated utility slots for accessories that are all must-haves, so you can focus your remaining slots on your character build.
Obviously this will have an impact on balance, so I'm working on adding a config option to disable the reforge modifiers on the utility accessories to not give too many stats.

[ChangeLog]
v1.1.0
* Implemented compatibility with WingSlot, the original mod, so having both installed works as intended.

------

This mod was built on top of the Wing Slot mod by abluescarab.  Below is their full description of the mod, kept for posterity and credit:

------

This mod adds a dedicated wing slot to the inventory. Now includes a config file! Access it from the in-game Mod Configuration.

* Left-click a set of wings or a dye, then place it in the slot.
* Right-click to equip wings.
* Shift-right-click to equip wings in the vanity slot.
* Right-click vanity wings to swap with equipped wings.
* Left-click the eye icon on the equip slot to toggle visibility.

[Known Issues]
* Yoraiz0r's Spell eye glow doesn't work
* Wings and character movement while flying will not display correctly in multiplayer
* Custom location will sometimes move off screen when resizing window (use mod config to reset if needed)
