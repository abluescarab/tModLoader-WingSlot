This mod adds dedicated utility slots for accessories that are all must-haves, so you can focus your remaining slots on your character build.
Obviously this will have an impact on balance, so I'm working on adding a config option to disable the reforge modifiers on the utility accessories to not give too many stats.

This mod was built on top of the Wing Slot mod by abluescarab.  Below is their full description of the mod, kept for posterity and credit:

------

!!! WARNING !!!
Unequip your wings[edited from original: and other utility accessories!!] from the dedicated slot before updating or disabling this mod!

This mod adds a dedicated wing slot to the inventory. Now includes a config file! Access it from the in-game Mod Configuration.

* Left-click a set of wings or a dye, then place it in the slot.
* Right-click to equip wings.
* Shift-right-click to equip wings in the vanity slot.
* Right-click vanity wings to swap with equipped wings.
* Left-click the eye icon on the equip slot to toggle visibility.

[Known Issues]
